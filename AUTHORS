In particular:

Depa and Amoz saw the Mother borning: They proposed some good ideas 
and a lot of bugs were discovered by them.

Thanks to Luis for his work and his testing activity. The SQLite 
support is one of his proposals and some chapter of the MotherManual 
are written by his hands.

Gregory fixed some bugs for the windows environment.

When Plone was used to build this site, Lio created the Mother logo 
and Balla was the main style designer. The migration of the site 
from Plone to html was supervised by Kecco.

Thanks to the Freaknet community, which hosts this site and the 
subversion repository.

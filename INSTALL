 * Mother Setup

To install mother, it's possible to use distutils or make.
If you are on Unix, using make is recommended, because the 
mothermapper manpage will be installed; be sure to be root
and: 

  # make install


To install Mother via distutils, just type:

  # python setup.py install

On windows, be sure that the `python` command is in your
path, otherwise you have to specify the full path of python,
for example:

  # C:\python25\python setup.py install

A new module will be created in site-packages and a script
will be installed: mothermapper.

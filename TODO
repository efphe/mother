* mothermapper has a slow computatinal model. For great DB, it's slow.
  Optimizations should be nice (see postgres autodoc).

* mothermapper new option -M: write the declaration of  Mother classes
  for each table on the DB, using MotherManager automatically when a 
  table has children or relations. Perhaps this is not a good idea

* drop relation: is it necessary to load related records?

* MotherFusion: getRecords() splitted for tables

* MotherFusion: is it possible to perform multiple joins?
   example: MotherFusion(ClsStars, ClsMoons)

* MotherCaster: implement mapping dict

* control file log rotation (time and activation)

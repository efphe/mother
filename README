Thanks to using Mother: enjoy!
Feel free to do, to think, to get, to give. 
Mother is free as in Freedom.

There is an interactive example on examples/sqlite.
The better idea is to read a little bit the official 
guide at:

    http://www.fenilot.org/mother_manual.html

and then running this sample. Note that before that 
you need to install Mother.

To install the module, just run the script setup.py as
usual (read INSTALL to know more).

Please, if you encounter Bugs, report them to the
Mother Mailing List: it will be very appreciated.

Thanks to using Mother: enjoy!
Feel free to do, to think, to get, to give. 
Mother is free as in Freedom.

There is an interactive example on examples/sqlite.
The better idea is to read a little bit the official 
guide at:

    http://www.dbmother.org/docs.html

and then running this sample. Note that before to run it,
you need to install Mother.

To install the module, just run the script setup.py as
usual (read INSTALL to know more).

Please, if you encounter Bugs, report them: it will be 
very appreciated.

Description: Object Relational Mapper with strong introspection
 Mother is a Python module that hides SQL syntax and gives you a set of 
 intelligent classes and methods. By `intelligent` we mean that the classes are 
 able to understand utonomously various situations.
 
 Think of Mother as an Object Relational Mapper with strong introspection. When 
 dealing with ORMs you usually need configuration files, tables, fields and keys
 declarations, but not with Mother because Mother knows the database structure
 herself.
 
 Mother currently works with PostgreSQL and SQLite.

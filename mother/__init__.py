Mother is a python module that hides SQL syntax and gives 
you a set of intelligent classes and methods. With `intelligent` 
we mean the capability of self-adaption, understanding various 
situations.
Mother could be considered as a Object Relational Mapper with a 
strong introspection. 
In fact, configuration files, tables, fields and keys declarations 
are not needed, because Mother knows the database structure herself.
Mother works with PostgreSQL and SQlite.

In particular:

Depa saw the Mother birth: he proposed some good ideas 
and he discovered a lot of bugs.

Thanks to Luis for his work and his testing activity. The SQLite 
support is one of his proposals and some chapter, of the MotherManual 
are written by his hands.

Gregory fixed some bugs for the windows environment.

When Plone was used to build the Mother site, Lio created the Mother logo 
and Balla was the main style designer. The migration of the site 
from Plone to html was supervised by Kecco.

Thanks to the Freaknet community, that hosts this site and the 
subversion repository.

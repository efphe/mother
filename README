Thanks to using Mother: enjoy!
Feel free to do, to think, to get, to give. 
Mother is free as in Freedom.

The better idea is to start reading the micro-howto at
www.dbmother.org or inside the directory doc/

The UserGuide is more complete:

    http://www.fenilot.org/mother_manual.html

To install the module, just run the script setup.py as
usual (read INSTALL to know more).

Please, if you encounter Bugs, report them to the
Mother Mailing List: it will be very appreciated.

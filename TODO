* mothermapper has a slow computatinal model. For great DB, it's slow.
  Optimizations should be nice (see postgres autodoc).

* mothermapper new option -M: write the declaration of  Mother classes
  for each table on the DB, using MotherManager automatically when a 
  table has children or relations. Perhaps this is not a good idea

* Let use MoFilter at the upper level.
    Done? Test!

* adding other database is now easy
  It seems that only pgres and sqlite are mother compatible
 
* Implements iterator on MotherBox and MotherFusion

* initChildManager and initRelationManager, if called without args,
  have to guess which tables to configure
 
* drop relation: is it necessary to load related records?

* MotherFusion: getRecords() splitted for tables

 * Mother Setup

To install mother, use distutils.

For example, on Unix:

  # python setup.py install

A new module will be created in site-packages and a script
will be installed: mothermapper.
This script has a man page: on Unix system, setup.py attempts
to install the man page on /usr/local/share/man/man1.
If this fails, the man page has to be installed manually in 
the proper directory, for example doing:

  # cp doc/mothermapper.1 /usr/share/man/man1
